Checklist for running variable resolution experiments:

Directory structure:
  [x] Copy input and code files from reference simulation
  [x] Run Jupyter notebook to create input files

/code files:
  SIZE.h
    [ ] Change resolution and MPI partitioning in SIZE.h file

[ ] Re-compile

/input files:
  data
    [ ] Multiply 1st term in delX and delY by 0.125 and 2nd by 8
    [ ] Multiply deltaT by 8 and nTimesteps by 0.125
    [ ] Multiply viscA4 and diffK4T parameters by 8^4
    [ ] Possibly change runtime, depending on whether or not you think the run will finish
  data.diagnostics
    [ ] Turn off all diagnostics except UVEL, VVEL, WVEL, THETA in levelDiag, and
        UVEL, VVEL, WVEL, THETA, DRHODR, ADVr_TH in meanDiag
  execution script
    [ ] Check that number of processors and nodes is consistent with SIZE.h code file

[ ] Submit execution batch script
[ ] Check that the job runs succesfully!
