Checklist for running variable resolution experiments:

Directory structure:
  [x] Copy input and code files from reference simulation
  [x] Run Jupyter notebook to create input files

/code files:
  SIZE.h
    [x] Change resolution and MPI partitioning in SIZE.h file

[x] Re-compile

/input files:
  data
    [x] Multiply 1st term in delX and delY by 2.0 and 2nd by 0.5
    [x] Multiply deltaT by 0.5 and nTimesteps by 2.0
    [x] Multiply viscA4 and diffK4T parameters by 0.5^4
    [x] Possibly change runtime, depending on whether or not you think the run will finish
  data.diagnostics
    [x] Turn off all diagnostics except UVEL, VVEL, WVEL, THETA in levelDiag, and
        UVEL, VVEL, WVEL, THETA, DRHODR, ADVr_TH in meanDiag
  execution script
    [x] Check that number of processors and nodes is consistent with SIZE.h code file

[x] Submit execution batch script
[ ] Check that the job runs succesfully!
